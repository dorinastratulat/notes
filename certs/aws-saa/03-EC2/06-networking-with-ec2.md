# EC2 06 - Networking With EC2

- networking options
  - Elastic Network Interface ([[ENI]])
    - basic day-to-day networking
    - private [[IPv4]], [[MAC]], public [[IPv4]], many [[IPv6]]
    - >= 1 security groups
    - use cases
      - management network
      - network and security appliances
      - dual homed instances, roles on distinct subnets
      - low-budget high-availability solution
  - Enhanced Networking ([[EN]])
    - single root I/O virtualization ([[SR-IOV]])
    - high performance networking
    - 10 Gbps - 100 Gbps
    - higher bandwidth
    - higher packet per second
    - consistently lower inter-instance latency
    - 2 ways to use it
      - Elastic Network Adapter ([[ENA]])
        - supports up to 100 Gbps
      - [[Intel 82599 Virtual Function interface|Intel 82599 Virtual Function (VF) Interface]]
        - supports up to 10 Gbps
        - used in older instances
  - Elastic Fabric Adapter ([[EFA]])
    - accelerate high performance computing ([[High Performance Computing|HPC]])
    - accelerate [[machine learning]]
    - network device you can attach to [[EC2]] instance
    - lower more consistent latency
    - OS-bypass enable [[High Performance Computing|HPC]] and [[Machine Learning|ML]] to bypass kernel and communicate directly on [[EFA]]
