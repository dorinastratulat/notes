# EC2 09 - Timing Workloads with Spot Instances

- spot instance
  - take advantage of unused [[EC2]] capacity
  - up to 90% discount from on-demand
- stateless, fault tolerant, flexible applications
  - [[big data]]
  - [[Container]]s
  - [[CICD|CI/CD]]
  - [[High Performance Computing|HPC]]
  - test/development workloads
  - image/media rendering
- decide maximum spot price
  - instance will be provisioned as long as current spot price is below your max spot price
  - hourly spot price varies depending on capacity and [[region]] and [[Availability Zone|AZ]]
  - if spot price goes above max, you have 2 minutes to decide
    - can stop an instance to resume later
    - can terminate an instance
- spot blocks
  - stop spot instances from being terminated
  - even if spot price goes above your max
  - block stops from 1-6 hours
- not good for
  - persistent workloads
  - critical jobs (don't want instances to be stopped)
  - databases
- spot fleets
  - collection of spot instances
    - optionally on-demand instances
  - attempts to launch the number of instances to meet the fleet request
  - the request is fulfilled if max spot price > current spot price
  - fleet maintains target capacity if spot instances are interrupted
