# EBS & EFS 09 - Exam Tips

- [[EBS]] SSD Volumes
  - [[High Availability|HA]], scalable storage volumes
  - attach to [[EC2]] instance
  - [[gp2]]
    - general purpose, boot disk
    - up to 16,000 [[IOPS]] per vol
    - up to 99.9% [[durability]]
  - [[gp3]]
    - high perf applications
    - 3,000 [[IOPS]] baseline perf
    - 125 MiB/s regardless of vol size
    - 99.9% [[durability]]
  - [[io1]]
    - [[OLTP]], latency-sensitive
    - 50 [[IOPS]] per GiB
    - up to 64,000 [[IOPS]] per vol
    - high performance and expensive
    - 99.9% [[durability]]
  - [[io2]]
    - [[OLTP]], latency-sensitive
    - 500 [[IOPS]] per GiB
    - up to 64,000 [[IOPS]] per vol
    - 99.999% [[durability]]
- [[EBS]] HDD Volumes
  - [[st1]]
    - [[big data]], [[data warehouse]], [[ETL]]
    - max [[throughput]] of 500 MB/s
    - can't be boot vol
    - 99.9% [[durability]]
  - [[sc1]]
    - less frequently accessed data
    - max [[throughput]] of 250 MB/s
    - can't be boot vol
    - lowest cost
    - 99.9% [[durability]]
- Snapshots
  - stored in [[S3]]
  - point-in-time image of volume
  - incremental/differential
  - first snap will take time
  - recommended to stop instance before snapshot
  - share between AWS accounts and [[region]]s but need to copy the snapshot first
- resize [[EBS]] vols on the fly
- [[Instance Store]]s
  - [[ephemeral]] store
  - reboot without losing data
  - cannot stop without losing data
  - delete on termination of instance by default
    - [[EBS]] vols can be changed
- [[AMI]]
  - blueprint for [[EC2]] instance
- Encrypted volumes
  - data at rest is encrypted
  - data in flight is encrypted
  - all snapshots are encrypted
  - all vols created from snapshots are encrypted
- [[EC2]] [[hibernation]]
  - saves [[RAM]] to disk
  - much faster boot-up
  - resumes processes
  - instance [[RAM]] < 150 GB
  - available for C, M, R families of [[EC2]]
  - win, amazon linux 2, ubuntu
  - can't be hibernated for > 60 days
  - on-demand instances and reserved instances
- [[EFS]]
  - [[NFSv4]] protocol
  - thousands of concurrent connections
  - pay for storage you use (no provisioning)
  - data stored across multiple [[Availability Zone|AZs]] in [[region]]
  - scale to petabytes
  - [[read-after-write consistency]]
  - linux only
- [[FSx for Windows]]
  - centralized windows shared storage
- [[FSx for Lustre]]
  - [[High Performance Computing|HPC]], [[Machine Learning|ML]]
  - can store data on [[S3]]
- AWS Backup
  - backup across AWS services
  - backup across AWS accounts with AWS Organizations
  - centralized control
  - automated backups
  - lifecycle policies
  - compliance 
-
