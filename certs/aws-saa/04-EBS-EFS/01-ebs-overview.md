# EBS & EFS 01 - EBS Overview

- [[EBS|Elastic Block Store (EBS)]]
	- different types of volumes
	- use cases for each volume type
	- attach to [[EC2]] instance
	- virtual hard disk in the cloud
- mission critical data
	- production workloads
- [[High Availability|highly available]]
	- automatically replicated within a single [[Availability Zone|AZ]]
	- protected against hardware failures
- scalable
	- dynamically increase capacity with no downtime or perf impact
- volume types
	- general purpose SSD ([[gp2]])
		- 3 [[IOPS]] per GiB
		- max 16,000 [[IOPS]] per volume
		- [[gp2]] volumes < 1TB can burst to 3,000 [[IOPS]]
		- good for boot volumes
		- development and test applications that aren't latency sensitive
  - general purpose SSD ([[gp3]])
    - new version of general purpose
    - predictable 3,000 [[IOPS]] baseline perf
    - 125 MiB/s regardless of vol size
    - high performance, low cost
      - [[MySQL]], [[Apache Cassandra|Cassandra], virtual desktop, [[Hadoop]]
    - scale up to 16,000 [[IOPS]] and 1,000 MiB/s for more money
    - top perf of [[gp3]] is 4x faster than max [[throughput]] of [[gp2]] vols
  - provisioned [[IOPS]] SSD ([[io1]])
    - legacy
    - up to 64,000 [[IOPS]] per volume (50 [[IOPS]] per GiB)
    - use if you need > 16,000 [[IOPS]]
    - high performance, most expensive
    - I/O-intensive applications
  - provisioned [[IOPS]] SSD ([[io2]])
    - same price as [[io1]]
    - [[Durability|higher durability]] and more [[IOPS]]
    - 500 [[IOPS]] per GiB
    - 99.999% [[Durability|durability]] instead of 99.9%
    - I/O-intensive applications
    - applications that need high levels of [[durability]]
  - [[Throughput]] Optimized HDD ([[st1]])
    - low cost HDD volume (magnetic storage)
    - baseline 40 MB/s per TB
    - burst 250 MB/s per TB
    - max [[throughput]] of 500 MB/s per vol
    - frequently accessed, [[throughput]] intensive workloads
      - [[Big data]], [[data warehouse]], [[ETL]], log processing
    - cost effective to store mountains of data
    - cannot be a boot vol
  - Cold HDD ([[sc1]])
    - lowest cost option
    - baseline of 12 MB/s per TB
    - burst to 80 MB/s per TB
    - max [[throughput]] of 250 MB/s per vol
    - good choice for colder data requiring few scans per day
      - file server
      - lowest cost and performance is not a factor
    - can't be a boot vol
- [[IOPS]]
  - number of read/write ops per second
  - use cases for this metric
    - quick transactions
    - low-latency apps
    - transactional workloads
  - ability to action reads and writes quickly
  - choose provisioned [[IOPS]] SSD ([[io1]], [[io2]])
- [[Throughput]]
  - measures number of bits read or written per second (MB/s)
  - use cases for this metric
    - large datasets
    - large I/O sizes
    - complex queries
  - deal with large datasets
  - choose [[throughput]] optimized HDD ([[st1]])
