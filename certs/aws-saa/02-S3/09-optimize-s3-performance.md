- [[S3]] prefixes
  - `bucket_name/folder/subfolder/object.jpg`
    - prefix: `folder/subfolder`
  - `bucket_name/folder2/subfolder/object.jpg`
    - prefix: `folder2/subfolder`
  - `bucket_name/folder3/object.jpg`
    - prefix: `folder3`
- Performance
  - low latency - first byte in 100-200 ms
  - 3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE per sec per prefix
  - 5500 GET/HEAD requests    per sec per prefix
  - more prefixes = higher performance
  - two prefixes = 11,000 requests/sec
  - four prefixes = 22,000 requests/sec
- Limitations
  - SSE-[[KMS]] has limits from [[KMS]]
    - Upload calls   `GenerateDataKey`  in [[KMS]] API
    - Download calls `Decrypt`         in [[KMS]] API
    - [[region]] specific limits
      - roughly 5,500, 10,000, or 30,000 requests/sec
      - counts towards [[KMS]] quota
      - can't request quota increase for [[KMS]]
- Multi-part uploads
  - >100 MB -> recommended
  - >5   GB -> required
  - parallelize uploads
  - chunking big file and uploading all chunks in parallel
- Byte-range fetches
  - parallelize downloads by specifying byte ranges
  - download failure only affects specific byte range
  - speed up downloads
  - download partial amounts of file (header info)

Review:
- prefix = folder and subfolder
- more prefixes = more performance
- SSE-[[KMS]] has builtin limits
  - counts towards [[KMS]] quota
  - can't increase quota
- multi-part uploads for big files
- byte-range fetch for downloading big files
