- [[s3]] object lock
  - store objects in [[Write Once Read Many|WORM]]
    - [[write once read many]]
  - prevent objects from being deleted or modified
    - fixed amount of time or indefinitely
  - use to meet regulatory requirements
  - extra layer of protection against changes and deletions
  - modes:
    - governance mode:
      - users can't overwrite or delete object version or alter lock settings unless given special permissions
      - project deletion from most users but still grant some users permission to alter retention or delete the object
    - compliance mode:
      - no one can delete or overwrite object (not even root user)
      - retention mode can't be changed, retention period can't be shortened
      - ensures object version cant be overwritten or deleted for duration of retention period
  - retention period
    - fixed amount of time for protection
    - [[s3]] stores a timestamp of when protection should expire
    - after expiry the object can be overwritten or deleted UNLESS legal hold is placed on object
    - legal hold:
      - [[s3]] object lock on an object version
      - remains in effect until removed
      - remove by user with permission
- glacier vault lock:
  - easily enforce compliance for individual glacier vaults with a vault lock policy
  - specify controls like [[Write Once Read Many|WORM]] in a policy
  - lock policy from future edits
  - once locked, the policy can't be changed

Review:
- [[Write Once Read Many|WORM]] = [[s3]] object lock
- object lock can be individual object or bucket wide
- governance mode and compliance mode
- [[Write Once Read Many|WORM]] + Glacier = glacier vault lock
- vault lock policy locked from future edits
