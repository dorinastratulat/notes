- Amazon [[RDS]]
	- db types
		- [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]], [[Oracle Database|Oracle]], [[MySQL]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[MariaDB]], [[Amazon Aurora]]
	- [[OLTP]] workloads
		- lots of small transactions
	- Not suitable for [[OLAP]]
		- use Redshift instead
	- read-replicas
		- scaling read performance
		- not for disaster recovery
		- requires automatic backups to be turned on 
		- multiple read-replicas are supported
			- 5 read-replicas for [[MySQL]], [[MariaDB]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[Oracle Database|Oracle]], [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]]
	- multi-[[Availability Zone|AZ]]
		- exact copy of database in another [[Availability Zone]]
		- used for disaster recovery
		- [[RDS]] will automatically failover to standby instance
		- not for increasing performance
		- backups are taken from the standby db
	- [[Amazon Aurora]]
		- proprietary [[RDBMS]]
		- [[MySQL]] & [[PostgreSQL]] compatible
		- always has 6 copies of your data
			- 2 copies of data in each [[Availability Zone|AZ]]
			- minimum of 3 [[Availability Zone]]s
		- share snapshots with other AWS accounts
		- 3 types of replicas available
			- [[Amazon Aurora|Aurora]] replicas
			- [[PostgreSQL]] or [[MySQL]] replicas
		- Automatic failover only available for Aurora replicas
		- automated backups enabled by default
		- [[Amazon Aurora|Aurora]] Serverless
			- simple cost effective for infrequent, intermittent, or unpredictable workloads
			- serverless database = Aurora Serverless
- [[DynamoDB]]
	- stored on SSD storage
	- spread accross 3 geographically distinct data centers
	- eventually consistent reads (by default)
		- consistency across all copies of data is usually reached within a second
		- repeating a read after a short time should return updated data
		- best read performance
	- strongly consistent reads (opt-in)
		- returns a result that reflects all writes that received a successful response prior to the read
			- kind of returning all writes that were committed successfuly before reading
	- Transactions
		- multiple all-or-nothing transactions
		- financial transactions
		- fulfilling orders
		- 3 options for reads
			- eventual consistency
			- strong consistency
			- transactional
		- 2 options for writes
			- standard
			- transactions
		- up to 25 items in a transaction or 4MB of data
	- question about [[ACID]] = [[DynamoDB]] Transaction
		- all-or-nothing transactions
	- on-demand backup and restore
		- full backup at any time
		- no impact on performance
		- consistent within seconds
		- retained until deleted
		- same [[region]] as source table
	- point-in-time recovery
		- protects against accidental writes or deletes
		- restore any point in the last 35 days
		- backups are incremental
		- not enabled by default
		- last restorable = 5 minutes in the past
	- streams
		- [[FIFO]] record streams
		- time-ordered sequence of item-level changes
		- stored for 24 hours
		- inserts, updates, deletes
		- combine with [[lambda]] to add functionality like stored procedures
	- global tables
		- managed multi-master multi-[[region]] replication
		- globally distributed applications
		- based on [[DynamoDB]] streams
		- multi-[[region]] redundancy for disaster recovery or [[high availability]]
		- no application rewrites
		- replication latency < 1 sec
- [[DocumentDB]]
	- mongo compatible databases in AWS
	- migrating
		- on-prem [[MongoDB]]
		- AWS DMS
		- Amazon [[DocumentDB]]
- [[Keyspaces]]
	- managed [[Apache Cassandra]] cluster in AWS cloud
- [[Neptune]]
	- [[graph database]] in AWS cloud
- [[QLDB]] (Quantum [[Ledger Database]])
	- immutable database
- [[Timestream]]
	- large amount of time-series data for analysis
	- time-series database
	- faster and more cost effective than relational for time-series
