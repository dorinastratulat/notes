# Databases 04 - DynamoDB

- what is [[DynamoDB]]
	- proprietary [[NoSQL]] database technology
	- consistent single-digit millisecond latency at any scale
	- fully managed
	- supports document and key-value data models
	- flexible reliable performance
- high level
	- stored on SSD storage
	- spread accross 3 geographically distinct datacenters
	- eventually consistent reads (default)
		- consistency accross copies of all data is usually reached within a second
		- repeating a read after a short time should return updated data
		- best read performance
	- strongly consistent reads (opt-in)
		- returns a result that reflects all writes that received a successful response prior to that read
		- no waiting for changes to take place
- DynamoDB Accelerator ([[DAX]])
	- fully managed
	- [[High Availability|highly available]]
	- in-memory cache
	- 10x performance improvement over [[DynamoDB]]
	- reduces request time from ms to Âµs even under load
	- no need for devs to manage caching logic
	- compatible with [[DynamoDB]] API calls
- on-demand capacity
	- pay-per-request pricing
	- balance between cost and performance
	- no minimum capacity
	- pay more per request than provisioned capacity
	- used for new product launches
- security
	- encryption at rest using [[KMS]]
	- site-to-site VPN
	- direct connect ([[DX]])
	- [[IAM]] policies and roles
		- fine-grained access
	- [[CloudWatch]] and [[CloudTrail]]
