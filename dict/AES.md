The AES [[Encryption]] algorithm (also known as the Rijndael algorithm) isÂ **a symmetric block cipher algorithm with a block/chunk size of 128 bits**. It converts these individual blocks using keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits. Once it encrypts these blocks, it joins them together to form the ciphertext.
