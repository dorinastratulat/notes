  

The NFSv4 protocolÂ **includes support for byte-range locking and share modes as part of the base protocol**. Locking in NFSv4 is lease-based, which requires the NFSv4 client to maintain contact with the server to preserve open and lock state owned by the client. The NFSv4 protocol introduces a compound request format.
