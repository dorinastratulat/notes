Enhanced networking uses single root I/O virtualization ([[SR-IOV]]) to provide high-performance networking capabilities onÂ [supported instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html#supported_instances). [[SR-IOV]] is a method of device virtualization that provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization when compared to traditional virtualized network interfaces. Enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and consistently lower inter-instance latencies. There is no additional charge for using enhanced networking.
